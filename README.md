You know when you want to watch something and you kind of know what you want to watch, but you don't really know what you what to watch?
That's where Watch Something comes in.

Select the decade and genre you want to watch and Watch Something will find you three movies to choose from. Hit search again for more.

If your selection is available on Prime, Rental or Digital purchase you can watch right now. Otherwise, you can order a copy and watch later.
