Watch Something presents a user with 3 random movie options. The user 
can select their choice of movie genre and decade and is presented with 3 other random choices 
within their query parameters. When a user selects a movie they will be brought to a page with movie trailer, details 
and results from an Amazon Product API call. The Amazon component will show the results from the Product API with viewing options.
